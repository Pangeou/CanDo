# CanDo Project

CanDo will be an alternative labour economy platform based on value rather than wages. The mission, concept and background information can be found here: https://candoproject.io/.

CanDo will be a decentralized platform operating on a cryptocurrency distributed leger network that supports smart contracts, digital identity and tokens. CanDo will be open source to allow different regions to make adjustments to fit their local needs. Dapps will have access to CanDo to check token balances and execute smart contracts.
