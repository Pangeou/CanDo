# CanDo
CanDo intorduces a new type of labour economy based on value rather than money.Value is created by people who give and receive services without a currency payment stored in banks and determined by employers. Transactions are made under just conditions without the intervention or regulation of third parties.  CanDo gives people the tools needed to bring social justice and equality in the world while reducing the exploitation of labour in the context of gender, ethnicity, nationality, tribe, age and disability.

On-costs:
Purchase of equipment, incidentals, travel and other relevant costs for the execution of a contract. For example, paint, cleaning products, website hosting, fuel and train tickets. These can be settled in the CanDo platform with the attachment of a valid tax invoice receipt. Should the receiver not cover these costs then she or he will receive bad ratings and will find it very hard to receive future services. A second option would be for givers and receivers to settle this outside the give platform. CanDofavours givers and receivers that are reliable and can be trusted.
